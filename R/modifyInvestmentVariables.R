#' Modify Investment Variables
#'
#' This function transforms investment variables to the normal reporting convention.
#'
#' Years represented by investment variables in the energy system
#' ('vm_deltaCap', 'vm_costInvTeDir' and 'vm_costInvTeAdj') are different from the normal
#' reporting convention. In the current REMIND version, vm_deltacap(t) represents
#' the average of the years t-4..t, while in the general reporting
#' convention it represents the average of t-2.5..t+2.5 (for 5 year time steps).

#' @param ref an optional magclass object to be used for fixing values before 'startYear'
#' @param startYear years before will be overwritten with values from 'ref'
